# Contributing to Jolt-Notes 🚀

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **jolt**! As a student developer, I really appreciate the help in making this tool better for everyone.

### 🎁 Contributor Rewards

* **25% off the Premium Plan for one year.**
<!-- TODO: -->
<!-- * **A "Contributor" badge** on your profile (if applicable in-app). -->

**How to claim:** After your PR is merged, email me at `newdawn.v0.0+contrib@gmail.com` with a link to your PR. I will send you a custom discount code for the hosted version!

### ⚖️ Legal Note (The "Small Print")
To ensure I can keep the hosted version of jolt-notes running and sustainable:
1. By contributing, you agree that your code will be licensed under the **AGPLv3**.
2. You grant  a non-exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free license to include your contribution in the official hosted/premium version of jolt-notes.

*This allows me to keep the project open-source while still being able to offer a "Cheap Premium" plan to pay for my studies and server costs.*

### How to get started
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code follows the existing style (run `nix fmt .` or equivalent).
3. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes.

Thank you for being part of the community!
